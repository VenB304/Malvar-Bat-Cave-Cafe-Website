# Archived Template Files

This folder contains the original **Lounge Template** files and unused assets that were part of the initial template but are not currently being used in the active project.

## Contents

### `Lounge Template/`
The complete original template directory with all its files, preserved for future reference.

### `template_images/`
Unused image assets from the original template including:
- Intro images (primary and secondary, standard and @2x)
- About page images
- Wheel images (500, 1000, 2000 versions)
- Sample images
- Avatar directory
- Gallery directory

### `styles.html`
The original template's style guide and component reference page.

## Purpose

These files are archived to:
1. Keep the active project directory clean and focused on current assets
2. Preserve original template files for future reference or feature additions
3. Allow easy restoration of template elements if needed later

## Active Project Files

The current project uses only the following from the original template:
- `css/style.css` (modified with custom color palette)
- `css/vendor.css`
- `js/main.js` and `js/plugins.js`
- `images/logo.png` (custom logo)
- `images/logo.svg` (fallback)
- `images/scrolldown-circle-text.svg`
- `images/icons/` directory

All other active files (`index.php`, `menu.php`, `booking.php`, `admin.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, `js/booking.js`) were created specifically for The Malvar Bat Cave Cafe project.
